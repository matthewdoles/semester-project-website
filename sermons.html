			<p>Just breathe. I think some of us had to remind ourselves to do just that at some points this week.
			And it’s not easy. When you have spent every bit of energy denying and fighting a possibility only for it to 
			then become a reality, and when that reality was made to fruition on a campaign of fear, hatred, and at the expense
			of marginalized groups of people, you begin to lose a little bit of yourself. You forget to breathe. And if you can’t
			understand why someone might feel a very real sense of fear after this election then I would invite you to talk to 
			one of us. I just wanted to say that as a sort of disclaimer, because I don’t want to make the mistake of assuming 
			anything. But that being said, having gotten to know you over the past few months I know that you are very empathetic
			and generous human beings, and I love that about ya’ll. So, I don’t have to explain to you that the hurt and fear so 
			many of us may be sharing is not just because we’re offended when the President-elect says the things he said. 
			I don’t need to repeat them, you know what they are. Whether he means the things he says or not doesn’t matter, words matter.
			And his words have given justification to hate groups for acts of violence already. White supremacy has not gone away in this
			country, if anything it’s getting a breath of fresh air. So this not some sort of fantastical fear. And I think what confuses 
			us the most, and for some what causes the most hurt, is that 81% of our white evangelical brothers and sisters in Christ said 
			none of that matters. If you’re like me, you know people, I mean I have family members, who love Jesus, and voted for Trump. 
			And there may be some people here this morning who did as well, so I’m not trying to shame anyone this morning. We need to resist 
			the temptation to dehumanize each other, because there is already too much of that happening on both sides of the aisle right now. 
			But I also don’t want to give you a over spiritualized response today, because that simply wouldn’t be true. This idea that God 
			orchestrated this election, yes God is sovereign, but God didn’t put Trump in office, we did. But the question remains, what do 
			we do when we’re lost in a world of confusion, frustration, fear, or anger. My message today is: step closer. Let’s first step 
			closer to the texts we have today, let’s take a step closer to God, and let’s take a step closer to each other and our neighbors.
			</p>
			
			<p>In Isaiah, we are given a glimpse of a new heaven and a new Earth. I just love the prophet’s ability to pull back the curtain a
			little bit and say, “Look at this.” The LORD is creating a new Jerusalem where there will be no sound of weeping, where infants will 
			not live only a few days, but people will live out full lifetimes. They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant, 
			and another eat. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like an ox. With this image in my mind, 
			I’m reminded of a couple of things. I’m reminded first, this was what God meant for. This was the reality God intended for us to live in. 
			And here is Isaiah, holding a snapshot of a reality that yes, was a missed opportunity—we live in a fallen world now, and that looks totally 
			different—but this is also a snapshot of a promised reality. And Isaiah is saying, take a step closer, and remember what God wanted for you, 
			and hang on to it. The church has been trying so hard to move forward, to usher in the new kingdom and the new Jerusalem that we have been 
			practically begging at the feet of God to get us the hell out of here. We’ve been desperate for an escape for so long now. But have we ever 
			actually and collectively taken a moment to mourn what was lost? The church needs to enter a season of lament. We’re a traumatized people and 
			we won’t acknowledge it. When we see images like in Isaiah our first thought is, “Ah yes, I can’t wait for that. Take me now, Lord!” It’s a trigger, 
			and we’re not able to stop and say, “What happened?” “Yeah, I want that too, but that is not what I’m seeing.” Any psychologist, therapist, or doctor 
			would tell you, you don’t force a victim of trauma to move on with their life without first allowing them significant time to mourn what was lost. 
			So why can’t we do that for ourselves? And this isn’t a wallowing in pity kind of thing. This is a lament, for which there is a long biblical tradition
			which serves as a precedent. Now, more than ever, we need to enter a season of lament for the culmination of events, for the history of violence, genocide,
			and injustices in our nation’s early history, the flourishment of white supremacy and bigotry, and the giving in to fears and hatred.	
			</p>
			
			<p>The passage in Luke 21 offers a very different kind of snapshot for us. We have a scene where Jesus tells a prophecy in response to a remark that 
			was made about the grandeur of the temple in Jerusalem. Jesus’ prophecy is that despite the majestic beauty of the temple, not one stone will remain.
			This prophecy had to have come as a devastating shock to those who heard it. The temple was the heart and soul of Israel and Israel’s worship of God.
			It was the housing place of God, and here is Jesus saying not one stone will remain. The beauty and the enormity of the temple has lured the people 
			into a false sense of indestructibility and invulnerability. Those who have been mesmerized by the temple’s magnificence will be blind to its destruction.
			Jesus speaks of the “days that will come” not as some far off eschatological end times event, but a very near future date for the disciples with whom 
			he is speaking. And when they hear this, you could naturally understand why they would think that the destruction of the temple would mean the end of 
			the world. But Jesus is saying the destruction of the temple will not mean the end of the world itself, but rather an event that marks the leading up to
			the end. So, they ask Jesus what signs will there be to indicate that this is taking place.  He says “Many will come in my name and say ‘I am he’ or 
			‘The time is near!’ but don’t go after them. You’ll hear of wars and insurrections, but don’t be terrified. Nations will rise against nations, 
			there’ll be earthquakes, famines, and plagues, but these are all just signs.” (In hindsight, we know that the Jews will revolt against the Romans a
			round 70 AD, and it is at that time the temple will be destroyed) But what I find most fascinating is that the “signs” the disciples were looking for
			were probably not wars, earthquakes, or famines. I imagine these things were difficult to discern as “signs” given that participating in war was 
			actually thought to be evidence of one’s devotion to God. But what Jesus is doing here is flipping their expectations on its head. What he is identifying
			as “signs” are everyday realities. Realities which humans have grown accustomed to as a normal course of their lives.			
			</p>
			
			<p>So at this point, the disciples have got to be thinking, “What do you mean those are signs? Those things have already been happening for a while now.
			” But then Jesus says, “Here’s the real kicker: they’re going to arrest you and persecute you. They’re going to bring you before kings and governors because of my name.”
			This foretells the story of the disciple’s mission in the face of bitter opposition, which is narrated in the Book of Acts where we see several stories of 
			the persecution of the disciples. And knowing that Jesus predicted that this persecution would occur actually gives the disciples some comfort in the face
			of their persecution. But at the time, they had to have been just totally floored by the things Jesus was saying. Not only is the temple going to be 
			destroyed—the very heart of our worship of God—but we’re going to be arrested and persecuted too? And yet, Jesus is saying this will not be the end. 
			Step closer and hear what I am saying. When you are arrested and brought before kings and governors, I am going to give you a word and wisdom that no one
			will be able to contradict or withstand. You will use that moment to testify to the things you have seen. And even if brothers and sisters and parents 
			betray you, “not a hair of your head will perish.”
			</p>

			<p>So, a couple of things. If I’m being honest, I wasn’t really looking forward to having to deal with this text. Last week, JR mentioned that here in
			21st century United States, Christians sometimes like to think of themselves as a persecuted people and a persecuted Church. And I agree: that’s just 
			simply not true. And my fear is that when we read this passage in Luke 21, we see ourselves in the disciples in first century Palestine about to face 
			Roman persecution. That’s not us. I think this was a very specific message for a very specific group of people. Our focus is in the wrong place, and we’re 
			missing a couple of important points here. The message I believe this text offers for us today is that chaos is not a sign of the end, for as much as we
			would like for it to be, it’s not. What it is though is a sign of the human fall. Violence, famine, and disease are the results of when nations and people 
			seek to grab hold of what they want or think they deserve. The version of this story that is told in Matthew’s gospel speaks of “wars and rumors of wars;
			see that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet.” I don’t know if there are any other fans of the hardcore punk music scene
			out there, or if it’s just me, but when I hear the words “Wars and Rumors of Wars” my mind immediately thinks of a famous album title by the same name of
			the well-beloved band, The Chariot. The very first line on that album is salient for us today: “Don’t let them sell you a cage, don’t bleed for blood that I have bled.”
			</p>
			
			<p>Jesus’ message to the disciples is my message for you today: step closer. Let the response of the disciples be an example for us. Don’t let chaos 
			dictate your life and your decisions. Step closer to God. And remain faithful, prayerful, and assured in Christ.
			</p>
			
			<p>Now, let us turn our attention briefly to Paul’s letter to the Thessalonians. Paul’s message addresses the question of what do we do when individuals 
			or parts of the body of Christ are living and acting in ways that are not scripturally or theologically appropriate. It appears that some members of the
			church in Thessalonica are no longer working, but sponging off the generosity and kindness of other members of the body. Their actions are not just 
			impacting themselves, but the whole community as well. Paul’s suggestion: anyone not willing to work, shouldn’t eat. This is less a command to just let 
			them go hungry and starve, than it is a command to just stop feeding them if they’re going to exploit your generosity and kindness. But Paul also doesn’t 
			want them to stop giving charitably, which is why he encourages them to “not be weary in doing what is right.” What is at stake for Paul is the unity of 
			the community, and individuals unwilling to contribute and be a part of the community pose a threat to that unity. Paul’s recommendation may seem harsh,
			but Paul’s focus is not so much on the Christian whose walk is disorderly, but the community at large who have let each other slip in such a way. 
			Paul’s goal is not to remove those individuals from the life of the church and the community, but to bring them back into fellowship. And if the rest 
			of the community is not willing to do that then that is a sign of a bigger problem at hand. The hope is that the brothers and sisters in Thessalonica 
			be reconciled to one another, just as we have been reconciled to God. And what is the only way that is going to be accomplished? By taking a step closer.
			</p>
			
			<p>And here lies the problem. People just want to be heard. This is why everyone turns to social media, it has become the easiest and quickest way to 
			make your voice heard. Some of you may have been on Facebook or Twitter throughout this week and noticed this. And you know what’s funny, all of the political 
			commentators seem to suggest that the biggest reason why people voted for Trump on Tuesday was because they felt that their voice wasn’t being heard in Washington.
			And it’s hard to disagree with that. But when did we stop listening to each other? How did we let so much distance get between us that we can’t hear when someone 
			says “the things this person is saying about immigrant communities or gay and lesbian communities doesn’t give me a whole lot of comfort.” Unfortunately, 
			this isn’t a new development in the United States. Dr. King commented on this when he said the most segregated hour in America is on Sunday mornings. The same 
			problem continues to persist. You want to be heard, I want to be heard. So let’s take a step closer to each other and actually listen. And maybe, 
			just maybe, we’ll take a step closer to God in the process.

			<h3 class="pagetitle">We Were All Thinking It</h3>
			<h5>October 23, 2016<h5>
			<h5>Lectionary Texts: Jeremiah 14:7-10, 19-22, 2 Timothy 4:6-8, 16-18, Luke 18:9-14</h5>
			
			<p>When I came across the texts for this week and I read the parable in Luke 18 I thought to myself, “Do I really need to preach on this text?” 
			This parable just seemed a little too ridiculous and unnecessary for a couple of reasons. First, isn’t this something that most people just get? 
			I mean this is basic Christianity 101 stuff right here. Don’t rely on or boast of your own “good works” for your righteousness like the Pharisee,
			but humble yourself and recognize that we have all sinned like the tax collector, and that we’re dependent on God’s grace. You know, this is real 
			basic stuff: we are justified by faith, not by works. That whole thing. And I also thought to myself, “Who really acts like that anyway?” Who goes 
			around saying, “You know what, thank you God that I’m not like that guy, am I right?” “Because that dude is a real bad sinner.” But the more I think 
			about it, the more I wonder whether this story is as outrageous as I had thought or am I just being naïve, and is the Pharisee in this parable just 
			saying what we’re all really thinking anyway? I’m not sure.
			</p>
			
			<p>Like I said, the major theme of this parable is that justification is grounded in the mercy of God, and this is actually the foundation for much of 
			Paul’s later teaching of justification by grace by trusting in the sufficient work of Christ. This theme and idea is highlighted by the two contrasting
			positions between the Pharisee and the tax collector. And if it helps, think of this as the parable of two prayers, because beneath these prayers we see
			the hearts of two individuals who contrast each other not only in the way they make their request, but in the way they approach God. And these two individuals
			could not be more polar opposites of each other in the first-century culture of Palestinian religion. The Pharisee approaches God with a boldness only a man 
			of his religious stature and societal position can do. He begins with what almost looks like a praise psalm, “I thank you God.” Typically with this sort of psalm,
			the petitioner will thank God or praise God for something God has done. But he distorts the praise psalm. The Pharisee is grateful, but for himself. 
			He is grateful that he is not like some other people he knows, and numbers off sins supposedly more atrocious than his: thieves, rogues, adulterers, or even worse tax collectors!
			</p>
			
			<p>So this is where the Pharisee really screws up. He assumes a position of confidence both physically and spiritually. The Pharisee stands straight while
			he prays, because he is so certain of his righteousness. So certain that he is even willing to compare himself in a favorable light to these other 
			unrighteous individuals that he names, individuals who have violated God’s law. But what is most remarkable about the “unrighteous violators” that he mentions
			is that the tax collector is the only one labeled a sinner simply by nature of his vocation. Now, why such the disdain for tax collectors? Well, in just
			about any given society you have your lower, middle, and upper classes. The majority of people in first century Palestine, as you can imagine, were in the 
			lower class. A very small number belonged to the middle class, comprised mostly of professional people such as business owners, skilled laborers like Jesus,
			and educated people such as the Pharisees. But an even smaller number of people belonged to the upper class and that included the tax collectors. In first 
			century Palestine, the tax collectors were specifically Jews who collected taxes from their fellow Jews for the Roman Empire, and in order to make a living 
			they charged an extra amount. However, some of them certainly made more than what was needed and profited off their neighbors. In this light, they were viewed 
			as traitors who made their wealth in cooperation with the imperialistic Roman Empire at the expense of their own people. In the mind of the Pharisee, this makes
			the tax collector a special type of sinner, someone who deliberately and constantly transgressed the requirement of the law. So when the Pharisee makes 
			reference to the tax collector in his prayer he is making an instant evaluation and judgment of the tax collector’s character simply because of his profession.
			But more so than that, the Pharisee thinks himself to be such a great guy because he goes above and beyond the call of duty of what is asked of him. He fasts 
			twice a week which is more than what the law requires, and he faithfully gives a tenth of what he earns. This is the basis for his superiority. And you hear 
			these things and you think, “is this guy serious? Does he really think he can impress God with these things?” Yes, yes he does. Keep in mind this is just a story
			Jesus is telling, not based on anyone specific, but do not doubt that any Pharisees or other I guess self-righteous people in the audience did indeed hold such a sour view of tax collectors.			
			</p>
			
			<p>Now, the tax collector could not be any more drastically different in his approach to God. He also stands, but he remains “far off” in the distance, suggesting
			some bit of shyness, unworthiness, or at the very least some respect in approaching God. Continuing in a sign of respect, he does not lift his eyes up to heaven, 
			but beats his chest in some sort of sign of contrition. His prayer is a simple one: “God, be merciful to me, a sinner!” This is a prayer of penitence, a plea for 
			mercy even. Here is a self-confessed sinner, who makes no comparisons, but recognizes one thing: his own need for God’s mercy. His only concern is improving his 
			own spiritual well-being, and the only way of doing that is through total reliance on God’s mercy. Now, in his request for mercy he uses an interesting word that
			translates the Hebrew word meaning “to cover.” The background and use of this particular word indicates that there is nothing that the petitioner can do to earn 
			forgiveness, so he or she simply makes an appeal for the forgiving compassion of God. He or she comes to God only seeking to improve his or her relationship with God.
			The text we read from Jeremiah 14 is a perfect example of just that. What we heard was essentially a vocal response of the people of God to a crisis of drought. 
			Leading up to the point of what was read, the people were lamenting their situation of crisis which turns into a lament of shame and despair. More specifically, 
			it is a confession of sin, which serves as a sort of public testimony of their recognition that they are the problem. They confess their sin in three different 
			ways just in one verse: iniquities, apostasies, and sin. This is a very direct and penitential confession. So, they ask God to act, not based on anything they 
			could possibly offer or bring to the table, but that God would act simply on the basis of God’s own namesake. Because with this confession of sin comes an equally
			strong confession of faith in God who acts as a savior, “O hope of Israel.” They call God a god of hope precisely because God has demonstrated to be the savior of 
			Israel before and throughout their existence as a people. What is interesting is that the people of Israel do not explicitly ask for the forgiveness of their sins, 
			which I think is because they recognize that they have broken the covenantal relationship with God. But rather, their approach is to invoke the name, and more specifically
			the reputation, of YHWH because tradition has shown God to respond to such a cry. Unfortunately for them, that tradition was only upheld if the covenantal relationship 
			was a healthy one, and we won’t get into it, but that was certainly not the case here. Fortunately for us, we have a new covenant in Jesus Christ. But, I think that 
			text is an excellent example of coming to the realization of our total dependence on God’s mercy. The people of Israel did not get the response of salvation from their 
			crisis which they were looking for and fully expecting from God. Yet, in the face of that, we see in the continuing verses that they go even deeper by acknowledging and
			confessing ancestral sins. Jeremiah urges them to continue in reliance on God’s mercy, despite being in the middle of a severe drought.
			</p>
			
			
			<p>Now as for us, like I said, we have a new covenant in Jesus, and what Jesus is indicating in this parable is a basic principle: that God honors humility. 
			It appears that the basic approach which God honors is one with the understanding that we don’t have the right to expect any sort of blessing for the things 
			we have done. It is not that the saint does not have the right to approach God with the boldness of the Pharisee, but that it should be a humble approach nonetheless. 
			While humility is exalted, pride, and especially religious pride, is condemned. We are not to assume we have it all figured out. Furthermore, if you want an image of 
			who you are as a child of God look at yourself in relation to who God is, not in the distorted image of comparing yourself to who others are. 
			</p>
			
			<p>At the beginning I asked who really acts like the Pharisee anyway. Who goes around saying, “Thank God I’m not like this person or that person?” This is the idea
			of Social Comparison Theory, which states that we determine our own social and personal worth based on how we stack up against others. Pretty much exactly what the
			Pharisee did. This causes people to constantly make not just self-evaluations, but evaluations of others across a variety of fronts. Most of us have the capacity and
			social skills to control these impulses and not make such judgments of character, but our true feelings come out in subtle ways. And this is truly unfortunate,
			because we are often such poor readers of character. I mentioned a couple of weeks ago that I have the privilege of going to Stateville Correctional Center once a 
			week and getting to learn alongside of the guys there. Now, how terribly ignorant and wrong would it be if I were to walk in there every week with a sense of societal
			superiority simply because they are prisoners and I am a free citizen. That would simply be a waste of time. In fact, I’ve made it a point before going there each
			day to take a posture of equality and learning, and I STILL walk out there eating a huge slice of humble pie every time. Yet, it is exactly this kind of attitude that
			prevents these formerly incarcerated men and women from finding a job once they leave prison. An individual could be fully rehabilitated, a totally transformed person,
			but that would not matter because they have to live with the label of “felon” for the rest of their life. Because they have to check a box every time they fill out a
			job application. Certainly they would be the first to admit that they have made mistakes in their lives, at least the gentlemen I have gotten to known the last couple 
			of months would. But that stigma of being a “felon” is crippling. But what’s worse is by allowing ourselves to make such a judgment of character of formerly incarcerated
			citizens, based on mistakes they made years in their past, not only do we discount their own rehabilitation, we discount the transformative power of Jesus Christ. 
			And where would we be without the transformation of Jesus Christ in our own lives? “Lord, be merciful to me, a sinner…”
			</p>
			
			<p>Humility is sobering. It forces you to take a look at where you stand, not forgetting that the only standard of comparison is with the character of God. 
			What I wish for us to take away from the tax collector today is that he knew just where he stood when he approached God. He fully understood that there was nothing
			that he has done or could ever do to stand before God with any sort of righteousness, but rather he was a product of God’s kindness and mercy. Furthermore, when
			we understand ourselves to be products of mercy, then that will ultimately breed more compassion in our lives. I am reminded of very powerful scene from Les Miserables.
			I’m sure many of you have either read or seen it, but I’ll set it up for you. In Victor Hugo’s novel, Jean Valjean spent 19 years in prison for the crime of 
			stealing a loaf of bread to save his sister and her children from starvation. By the time Valjean was released from prison, all that he had known about his 
			life beyond prison walls was gone—just as it will be for a few of my friends at Stateville and thousands of other formerly incarcerated Americans. All too many of
			them will find themselves in the situation Jean Valjean found himself in: alone, desperate, and with no place to go. They too will be turned away like Jean 
			Valjean was from innkeepers because his passport marks him as a convict. Out of options, Jean Valjean knocks on the door of Bishop Bienvenue who graciously feeds
			him and allows him to spend the night. But, out of his own fear and desperation Jean Valjean steals some silverware and flees in the middle of the night, 
			only to be apprehended by the police and returned to the Bishop’s house to answer for his crime that morning. However, the Bishop recognizes that the theft of
			some silverware pales in comparison to the real crime of 19 years being stolen from Jean Valjean’s life—and a few pieces of silverware does not make up for that.
			To the dismay of the police and the astonishment of Jean Valjean, the Bishop declared the silverware to be a gift he had freely given, and even throws in two 
			candlesticks which he claims Jean Valjean had forgotten. This single act of kindness and compassion would set in motion the transformation that would take place
			in the life of Jean Valjean, a man who would in turn transform others. The Bishop refused to see anything other than a fellow a human being in need in Jean Valjean.
			Not a convict. Not a felon. But another child of God. A sinner, like himself, in need of some mercy.
			</p>
			
			<p>So, may God grant us mercy and may we live lives of love and compassion. Amen.</p>

			<h3 class="pagetitle">The Heart of the Gospel</h3>
			<h5>September 25, 2016<h5>
			<h5>Lectionary Texts: Amos 6:1a, 4-7, 1 Timothy 6:6-19, Luke 16:19-31</h5>
			
			<p>Well, last week we read that we cannot serve two masters; we cannot serve both God and wealth. And it seems that today we have another text dealing with 
			wealth and money. I realize that you probably neither expected nor want to hear back to back sermons about wealth or riches. So I promise you that is not what
			you are going to get this morning. But we shouldn’t ignore the fact that apparently Jesus had a lot to say on this subject. And really, I think it is best to
			think of this text and this sermon as a continuation of the conversation from last week, because really it pretty much picks up from where we left off in the
			text from last week. Jesus told the parable of the dishonest manager, concluding with “you cannot serve God and wealth.” The very next verse says, “The Pharisees,
			who were lovers of money, heard all this, and they ridiculed him.” According to Luke, apparently there is some sort of connection here between the Pharisees’ 
			love of money and their ridicule of Jesus. Sadly, theological positions and opinions are not always disconnected from economic interests and agendas. 
			This was the case for the Pharisees, and they knew it. So how do they respond? Deflect, deflect, deflect. Really, I see their response as more of a defense
			mechanism than anything because they knew they were in the wrong. I’ve been seeing this a lot lately actually. One of our presidential candidates has based
			his entire campaign strategy on this idea: whenever someone calls him out on his lies, misdeeds, or wrongs, his strategy is to simply ridicule his opponent
			until that’s all anyone can hear. And unfortunately it’s been working. But Jesus responds to the Pharisees’ ridicule by insisting that what he is teaching 
			is in line with the heart of the Law and the Prophets. He then begins this parable of the rich man and Lazarus, which where our text picks up from this morning.
			</p>
			
			<p>	We are told there was rich man dressed in purple and fine linen, a color not easy to come by and reserved for royalty and the wealthy, who feasted, 
			not just occasionally, but every day. The ostentatious display of wealth had been a characteristic developed by the Palestinian upper class, whom they most
			likely inherited from the Romans.  The life of extravagance depicted of the rich man is already preparing the reader for the inevitable negative outcome 
			that is to come. And then there was a poor man who lay at the gate of the rich man, undoubtedly to beg, who was covered in sores.  What is remarkable about 
			the poor man in this parable is that he is given a name, which Jesus does not do in any of his other parables. And not just any name, but a familiar and very
			specific name, Lazarus. There is no reason for us to believe this is the same Lazarus whom Jesus raised from the dead, because all he is doing here is telling 
			us a story. But his audience would have recognized and understood that the name Lazarus means “God helps” or “God helped.” Lazarus’ name “names” the reality 
			of his condition: only God can help him. Because while the rich man feasted every day, just outside his gate lays Lazarus “who longed to satisfy his hunger 
			with what fell from the rich man’s table,” but instead was met with the humility and degradation of dogs (not puppies, but mangy street dogs) who licked his sores.
			How hard could it have been for the rich man to simply have someone bring his leftovers out to Lazarus at the end of his meal? Let alone, the possibility of inviting
			him in for dinner! The sin of the rich man was not that he was rich or wealthy, it was that he could have easily extended a helping hand to his neighbor, Lazarus, 
			but instead chose to gate him off and turn a blind eye to his suffering. The fact that they were close enough that he knew Lazarus’ name even, makes the rich man all
			the more culpable. Verse 24 indicates this when after they have both died the rich man cries out to Father Abraham, “Have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip
			of his finger in water and cool my tongue.” Sometimes silence does more harm than anything else.

			<p>This has been a particularly rough last week or two in the news. It has been even harder for our brothers and sisters of color as more unarmed black men have been murdered.
			The blood of Keith Lamont Scott, Terrence Crutcher, Alton Sterling, Antwon Shumpert, David Joseph, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner cry out for justice.
			For the better part of history, White America has closed off its gates and ignored the cries for help coming from our brother, Lazarus. If that’s the case, this story paints a
			grave picture for us. Our silence of the injustices done against our neighbors has made us just as guilty as the rich man. We cannot remain silent any longer.
			</p>
			
			<p>We have such a small window of opportunity to do what is right in this lifetime. The gap between the rich and the poor, the haves and the have nots, the privileged and the 
			oppressed is still very bridgeable. What this parable also show us is the chasm of separation between the rich man and Lazarus in the afterlife demonstrates and the finality 
			of death. As the story continues, both men die. The rich man was buried, but Lazarus was carried away into heaven by angels where he enjoyed the close company of the patriarch
			Abraham while the rich man suffered the torment of Hades. Hades generally represented a place of the dead in Jewish and Greek literature, but this parable invokes images of 
			the rich man below looking up at Lazarus above next to Abraham. It also captures the theme of the Old Testament that God will not ignore those who are afflicted, and that those
			who close their ears to the cries of the poor will themselves cry out and not be heard. As we can see, the arrogance of the rich man continues into the afterlife, as he 
			requests Abraham to send Lazarus to him to cool his tongue with water. The irony is that the one who denied any hospitality to Lazarus pleads with the figure who epitomized
			hospitality to the needy and the stranger in the Old Testament. Abraham’s response to him is that you enjoyed an entire life of good things while you left Lazarus to suffer evil,
			it is his turn to be comforted. Besides, even if I wanted to help you, I couldn’t’, because a great chasm has been fixed making it impossible for one side to cross over to the other.
			Whereas only a gate stood in the way of mercy before, now there is a great chasm, as by God’s just purposes. This story truly is fascinating. The rich man and Lazarus were so 
			close to each in other spatial proximity, yet they could not be further apart in terms of social status and life circumstances. And now in the afterlife, they are even further 
			separated. The picture that is painted of delight vs misery and poverty vs prosperity here may cause a bit of discomfort for the 21st century reader. Because this is not some 
			ancient exotic tale. Images of luxury resorts and gated homes that have sought to keep the expendable poor away at a “safe” distance may come to mind. Even our own city
			of Chicago has a notorious history of redlining neighborhoods; the detestable practice of not selling homes to certain group of people because, well, this is a nice 
			neighborhood. What I’m saying is not that it’s wrong to have the nice home with the nice things, but we have the privilege to have a choice. The rich man chose to ignore
			the needy, just right outside his home. I would argue that Lazarus did not have a lot of choices in his life. You know, in the church and in some Christian circles, 
			we like to talk a lot about the Kingdom of God, or doing the work of the Kingdom. But not everyone agrees on what that is. There are over 300 verses in the Bible 
			talk about the poor. The words “wealth” and “justice” appear nearly 1,500 times. I mean, this is a fundamental concern of God’s. If there is anything that the church
			should be doing it is taking care of the poor. Coming up in a few weeks I believe we will have the opportunity to do some work with Night Ministry and to do just that.
			If you are able, I would really encourage everyone to do that. Let me just also say, this is not a “GIVE MORE MONEY TO THE CHURCH” kind of thing (bc I’ve seen how generous 
			ya’ll are), it's more of a “do we see the poor around us, and are we being humanizing with them.” I can’t help but also relate this to the election season. If as Christians we 
			believe that care for the poor is at the heart of the gospel then we have to asking ourselves which candidate is going to do that. I’m not sure someone should be a single issue
			voter, but if I were to be one, I would have to give this consideration.
			</p>
			
			<p>The rich man makes one more request, actually he begs. He begs Abraham to send Lazarus to his brother’s so that he may warn them, and so that they won’t also experience 
			the torment of Hades. While it may appear that the rich man for a brief moment was concerned about someone other than himself, in reality the family was regarded as an 
			extension of himself, so he is still actually looking after his own interests. I also think this final plea was an attempt at self-justification as well. You know, by
			saying “Oh, if only someone would warned me, I would have never ended up in this horrible place.” Abraham replies, “They have Moses and the prophets, they should listen to
			them.” But the rich man insists: “but if someone goes to them, they will repent.” And then we are left with Abraham’s final response, “If they do not listen to Moses and 
			the prophets, neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.” There are two things to unpack here. First of all, the Scriptures give plenty of grave 
			warnings of what happens to those who live a life of greed and self-interest. The problem for them, for the rich man, and for the Pharisees (the audience of this parable 
			if you remember) is that the word is not on their hearts, particularly the command to take care of the poor. This is what is meant by “they have Moses and the prophets, 
			they should listen to them.” The rich man’s choice to ignore the needy just outside his gate amounted to a failure to truly hear the word that was in the Law and the Prophets, 
			which was Jesus’ whole point with the Pharisees. An authentic hearing of the message includes the call to take care of the poor. Jesus is indicating that it is a
			life and death situation, for this life and beyond.  The second point is this: not even a messenger from the dead (wink wink the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ)
			will lead a person to faith and obedience who place other vested interests and values above obedience to God.
			</p>
			
			<p>You know, while preparing for this sermon I stumbled upon a sermon the current Pope gave on this same text not too long ago back in May. I was thrilled to 
			find out that our messages were pretty much the same, but of course he is able to use his words much more eloquently than I could. So, I’ll leave you with a few
			of those.  The main point of his message was that how Christians treat the poor is the clearest demonstration of their relationship with God. He said, “To ignore
			the poor is to despise God!” Lazarus represents both the “silent cry of the poor of all time and the contradiction of a world in which vast wealth and resources 
			are in the hands of a few.” “How many times so many people pretend to not see the poor; for them the poor do not exist!” “No messenger and no message can substitute
			the poor we meet along the way because through them we meet Jesus himself.”
