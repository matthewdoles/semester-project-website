			<h3 class="pagetitle">Spiritual Journey</h3>
			<br/>
			<p>My story is like many other stories of individuals who have grown up in the 
			church and then struggled to make their faith their own. All throughout my life I 
			have been an active participant in the life and	community of the church. As a child 
			and into my teenage years, I was never forced to attend church on Sunday mornings or
			youth group on Wednesday and Sunday nights. It was something I wanted and chose to do.
			Most of my relationships and my friend circles were also in the church, which certainly 
			influenced my decision. There is not one clear moment in my memory where I recall dedicating 
			my life to Christ, but several similar moments.

			<h3 class="pagetitle">Call to Ministry</h3>
			<br/>
			<p>I remember being on a church retreat where I spent that entire weekend just trying to
			surrender my confusion and frustration to God and asking for some sort of direction. 
			When I returned home and spent some time reflecting on the weekend and on the summer that 
			I felt it. What I realized was that I am very limited as a teacher, but where showed strength 
			and where I found the most joy in teaching were things that a pastor does: walking, learning, 
			and growing with people. I approached my friends, family, and pastor with this revelation and 
			they all recognized these traits in me and truly affirmed my pursuit in ministry, and this has
			continued to be affirmed throughout my time in seminary.
